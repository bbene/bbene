Hi! I'm Ben Benesh. I'm a senior application developer focusing mainly on APIs with PHP. 
My professional home is at [@dealerinspire](https://github.com/dealerinspire) / [@carsdotcom](https://github.com/carsdotcom).

When I'm not coding I am a volunteer Emergency Medical Responder for my local townships. 
I am also an amateur radio operator with interest in emergency communications and modernizing ham radio technology.
